Week 8 Challenge
For this week's challenge I consulted our past class recordings and activities, relying heavily on activities in Week 8 across days 1 -3.  I resolved questions related to the instructions/references to data frames that weren't correct by trial and error, as well as conferring with fellow class mates to confirm my interpretations.
